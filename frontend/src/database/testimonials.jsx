We found their skills are far more advanced and trustworthy than any of the technology vendors we have. As a result, now BGUS is covering more widened scope of work that initially allocated. They have gained an excellent reputation in the whole organization especially in the design and implementation of IP telephony networks. They have significant experience in Cisco Contact Centre design and implementation for a number of call centres and distributed call centre environments.
        Saurabh and his team have a strong background in multiple technologies. They also have experience in implementing CUBE - Flow-through / Flow-around / Hybrid Models and fixed the critical issues most of the times. I would highly recommend them.
